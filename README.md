# FundoHomeTest

This is a simple and functional solution to the coding test published by [Fundo](https://github.com/richardfundo/take-home-test), and available on Github.

The solution is divided in 2 parts, one with the back end project, and another one for the front end.

## Organization

```text
    FundoHomeTest
                |
                |- backend
                |- frontend
                |- LICENSE
                |- README.md
```

In each section you will find a **README** file with the necessary information to configure and run the applications.

## Pending and things to improve

Everything in life is susceptible to improvement, even more so when you work against time, because every time you review what you have done, you will undoubtedly find a multitude of things that you can and surely want to improve.

**Among the outstanding items, the following stand out:**

* Unit/Integration tests (developing them usually takes more time than the development of the application itself, when I realized, I no longer had time for it).

**Here are some things that I will update later:**

1 - The data model:

I understand that the exercise is oriented to evaluate the candidate's knowledge and mastery of the selected technologies, but I still feel that using a more elaborate data model makes things more interesting, and it seems to me that something very interesting can come out of this initiative. At the moment I have 2 data models that I would like to explore:

* [Bank Database](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~wilfred/dbweb/erd.html)
* [Loan Management System](https://databasesample.com/database/loan-management-system-database)

The first one is perfect to work on in class, the second one is already a masochism :joy:

A more complex data model, it justifies the use of a more complex architecture, such as microservices, which would ensure me a few hours of fun.

2 -  More solid architecture:

When thinking about a more complex business need, a more robust architecture is justified, for example, a microservices-based architecture.

So that will be the next step, of course after extracting material for a couple of articles, or classes on how to create those databases from scratch with EF for different database engines. :blush:

3 - Improve the folder structure of both solutions:

Given the simplicity of the challenge, I opted to use a light but functional folder structure, inspired by Clean, always respecting good practices, but I would like to do it again using a microservices approach with a folder layout suited to it.

You know, make it look like a large-scale application. :sunglasses:

4 - Best practices and use of technologies:

The exercise is very basic, and usually with a fixed time frame, so it is difficult to implement some of the best practices from [12factor](https://12factor.net/) , if I scale the business need, I would opt to cover those practices, and make use of platforms commonly used in real projects, to the extent feasible.

5 - Let's stop here...

Let's stop here, because I feel that we could go on forever, to the point of making it unfeasible, and I want to continue with this burning desire to take the exercise further without dying in the attempt... :sweat_smile:
